\section{Purpose of This System}

\subsection{Our Problem}

In 2015, there were more than 4,600 higher-education institutions in the United States. Virtually all of them offer a breadth of college courses for students to complete and take them through their academic careers. At the end of a course, students typically fill out an evaluation so that teachers know what they are doing right and wrong. Unfortunately, many institutions, such as the University of Maine, are behind in using technology for this task.

The University of Maine has traditionally used Scantron sheets for course evaluation forms. As Team EVAL knows, filling in tiny bubbles with pencil and paper is tedious. It is also hard work for the college administration to use Scantron sheets. They need to scan the forms for every student in every course, and the data then needs to be collected in a form that is readable for instructors. The University of Maine must upgrade to keep with the times and exploit today's technology.

\subsection{Existing Survey Software}

Several software solutions currently exist that allow users to create, modify, and publish surveys. One notable example is LimeSurvey, a free and open-source tool that is operated online. The team acknowledges the immense amount of work put into creating LimeSurvey, with its selection of question types, scalability, visualization features, and other powerful functionality. However, LimeSurvey has always been general-purpose software; it is aimed at multiple types of users who want to make surveys.

College teachers and administrators need to jump through hoops to use a tool like LimeSurvey which are not always easy or intuitive. Their evaluations are highly standardized and they are sent to potentially hundreds of students. LimeSurvey and similar software do not account for these qualities. A college instructor would have to manually input every field, question, and class roll into each evaluation from scratch.  UMaine is using another service, Blue by Explorance, that has the necessary functionality, but it is expensive to use for a university and impossible to use for individuals. These are some of the reasons why our client, Dr. Onsrud, wants us to create an evaluation system better suited to instructors.

\section{About This System}

\subsection{System Requirements}

Near the beginning of the project, we met with Professor Onsrud to solicit the system requirements, what the evaluation system must do to function as Dr. Onsrud intends. The System Requirements Specification (SRS) divides the requirements into two categories. The functional requirements specify the major actions a user can perform with the system. They are listed in Table 1 below:

\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{3.5cm}|p{6cm}|} 
\hline
\textbf{Number} & \textbf{Priority} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
1 & 5 & Log in to system & A user logs in with a Google e-mail address and password \\ 
\hline
2 & 5 & Create evaluation & A user creates a new evaluation form for a class \\ 
\hline
3 & 5 & Edit evaluation & A user enters and edits information and questions for an evaluation form \\  
\hline
4 & 5 & Publish evaluation & A user publishes an evaluation form \\
\hline
5 & 5 & View evaluation results & The user reviews a course's or category of courses' results \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Functional requirements}
\end{center}

The non-functional requirements state the system's qualities that are irrelevant to how the program behaves. They are listed below in Table 2:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Number} & \textbf{Priority} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
1 & 3 & The software should be supported by the latest versions of Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android.\\ 
\hline
2 & 4 & The software should be accessible by the latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.\\ 
\hline
3 & 5 & All questions entered by the teacher or administrator shall appear on the output survey.\\  
\hline
4 & 5 & All data stored in the program's database shall be valid.\\
\hline
5 & 5 & All collected survey data shall not be alterable.\\ 
\hline
6 & 4 & Teachers shall not be able to access data of courses other than their own.\\ 
\hline
7 & 3 & The mean time between failures should be at least 60 minutes.\\ 
\hline
8 & 5 & Students shall have no access to any data stored by the program.\\ 
\hline
9 & 5 & All survey responses (except signed \newline comments) shall be anonymous.\\ 
\hline
10 & 2 & The software should scale to at least three universites, 1000 courses per semester, 1000 teachers per university, and 500 students per course.\\  
\hline
11 & 1 & The software should not exceed 500 MB in size.\\
\hline
12 & 4 & The software's source code shall be open-source and shall use a GPLv2 license.\\ 
\hline
13 & 4 & The licensing requirements of any non-original code shall be met.\\ 
\hline
14 & 4 & The software shall meet UMaine AFUM requirements.\\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}

Our system features a modular design, with many distinct parts which communicate via an API. The front end implements the user interface, written in JavaScript. The back end communicates with the system's databases and is written in Python. We are using two databases, one maintained by LimeSurvey and another maintained by our system. Additionally, the API will communicate with Google Authentication to authenticate users. The design and implementation of our system can be found in the System Design Document (SDD). The system's components are displayed in Figure 1 above.

By maintaining a modular approach to the design of the system, team members can work independently on individual parts, which will then undergo integration testing. Moreover, by keeping the LimeSurvey codebase separate from our system, we can update LimeSurvey without disrupting other parts of the code.
