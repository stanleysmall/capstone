\section{Introduction}

Team EVAL is creating a system to more efficiently create and distribute post-semester teaching evaluations. Our system must be properly inspected so that it is free from all defects and meets functional requirements as laid out in the System Requirements Specification document.
 
\subsection{Purpose of This Document}

The code inspection report is a detailed overview of the walkthrough our team made to ensure that the course evaluation system works as intended. The first section of the document mentions the coding conventions that the team used as guidelines, as well as a list of defects we checked during the review. The second section details our inspection process, how it deviated from a typical inspection, and Team EVAL's feelings about it. The last sections describe the system components inspected and the defects we found.

This document is intended for the development team, the product client, Dr. Harlan Onsrud, and potential users of the system. Team EVAL needs this document to fix the defects that we found during inspection and keep the defect checklist in mind. Dr. Onsrud needs it to confirm that Team EVAL is meeting requirements and caring about code quality. Lastly, the document helps the software's users by telling how the actual modules differ from how they were designed in the SDD.

\subsection{Coding and Commenting Conventions}

Team EVAL has adopted several guidelines for proper code and commenting to have a more consistent code base. In code inspections these standards will be referenced better understand what kinds of defects may be present in the code inspected.

For the Python code in the back-end API, the team is following the official Python style guide, PEP 8, and the docstring conventions in PEP 257. Available on the Python website, PEP 8 and 257 were written in 2001 by the creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, and other core developers. Both guides in turn were derived by van Rossum's original style guide for Python. PEP 8 covers topics such as indentation, line length, imports, whitespace, comments, and naming. PEP 257 has brief guidelines on documentation strings.

For the JavaScript code written on the front end, Team EVAL is following the Google JavaScript Style Guide. Google uses JavaScript so much for its front-end projects that it wrote conventions on how to properly write in the language. The standards in this guide are followed by Google's developers for their own development. The style guide includes guidelines on issues like source file structure, indentation, whitespace, comments, literals, naming, and JavaScript's documentation language, JSDoc. 

\subsection{Defect Checklist}

The team created a list of possible defects that could be encountered during our inspection. Much of the defect list references the style guides mentioned in the previous section. Each defect falls under one of four categories: violations of coding conventions, control flow errors, flaws in the system's security, and violations of commenting standards. The list is shown in Table 1 on the next page:

\section{Code Inspection Process}

\subsection{Description}

The code inspection process that Team EVAL followed was more informal than a typical Fagan inspection. Our team compared the process that we followed at the inspection meeting to a walkthrough as described by Williams in the text Intro to Software Engineering. Our process diverged from the typical inspection in an attempt to save time, allow for a more flexible meeting style, and a more casual atmosphere.

Before the inspection, the team decided the time and location of the meeting and who would take each role. Next, Stan and Jovon wrote the defect checklist so that the team could use it as a reference for what defects could be found. During the inspection, Stan led the proceedings as the ``moderator'', and Sam was the ``recorder'', typing down any defects encountered. The author of a module took on the ``author'' and ``reader'' roles. All members of the team were ``inspectors'', pointing out flaws in the code. Some flaws referenced the style guides described earlier in this report.

\subsection{Impressions of the Process}
Our inspection process proved very effective. We were able to find a number of defects or simple fixes that may have not been caught without the inspection. It also helped the team focus on continuity and consistency in our code. It was very beneficial to sit down as a team and walk through every file in our growing project.  As the project grows in size it is easy for things to fall through the cracks when trying to produce high quality code.  Sitting down as a team and systematically going through every file in our repository caused us to double check work which we previously may not have.  Since our project has several separate components, it was useful for each of us to see files that we may have not contributed to and have the original authors explain them.
	We were able to find defects and discuss possible solutions to them quickly. We did not waste time delving into exact solutions of larger issues but many of our defects were quick fixes and it was important to discuss them as a team. The process seemed beneficial enough for a team and project this size that it would be useful to do the exact same process several times throughout development.


\subsection{Inspection Meetings}

We held one inspection meeting to make our code inspection report. This meeting took place in a physical location, Boardman Hall 136. It occurred on March 6, 2019, from 3 PM to 4:15 PM. Everyone on Team EVAL (Jovon, Sam, Yuanqi, Robert, and Stan) participated in the inspection. Stan was the moderator of the inspection, Sam was the recorder, whoever wrote a modular unit served as the author and reader, and all team members were inspectors. The meeting covered every code unit in the system that is not automatically generated, including Dockerfiles, JavaScript files, and Python scripts.

\section{Modules Inspected}

In our inspection meeting, we looked through any module that was integral to our course evaluation system. The team defines a module as any individual script that the system can run. Table 2 below lists each module examined, its functionality, and how it fits into the design mentioned in the SDD.

Some of the modules in the system are not yet completed. MENTION INCOMPLETE MODULES AND THEIR ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES.

There are several differences between the actual design of a few of the modules and what was proposed in the System Design Document. DESCRIBE DIFFERENCES HERE.

\section{Defects}

During the inspection, the team found multiple defects in the system, spread across many different components. Table 3 below gives a list of all the defects that we found. Each defects falls under one of five categories: correctness to the functional requirements, coding conventions, commenting conventions, user friendliness, and miscellaneous flaws.
