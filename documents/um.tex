\section{Introduction}

Team EVAL is creating a system to more efficiently create and distribute post-semester teaching evaluations. Our client, Dr. Harlan Onsrud, a professor at the University of Maine, wants us to build such a system. He claims that the current system used by the University of Maine does not meet the needs of the faculty.

The old system relied on bubble sheets and physical forms to be submitted to create an evauluation survey. There was very little customization allowed for the courses and every survey was essentially the same. Our system will allow the instructors to create a evauluation form online and distribute it via email to their students. They can include whichever questions they desire and even add custom ones. Once a survey is completed the instructor can view the results digitally as well, rounding off an entirely digital process.
  
\subsection{Intended Readership}

This document is intended for the development team, the product client Dr. Harlan Onsrud, and any potential users of the system. These users will primarily be University of Maine faculty such as instructors or course administrators. Other users may include instructors of courses at other universities, or anyone teaching a class outside of a university setting that may be interested in creating a course evaluation form.

University of Maine faculty should already be experienced with the course evaluation format and will need little to no guidance to use the software. Other users should also be able to quickly pick up the software and make a course evaulation form despite their unfamiliarity with the format. These users should reference the `Instructions' section in order to learn the basics of evaluation system.
