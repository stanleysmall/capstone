\section{Introduction}

Team EVAL is creating a system to more efficiently create and distribute post-semester teaching evaluations. Our client, Dr. Harlan Onsrud, a professor at the University of Maine, wants us to build such a system. He claims that the current system used by UMaine does not meet the needs of the faculty.

The old system relies on using physical bubble sheets as evaluation surveys. Our system will allow the instructors to create a evaluation form online and distribute it via e-mail to their students. They can include whatever questions they desire and even add custom ones. Once a survey is completed, the instructor can view the results digitally, rounding off an entirely electronic process.
  
\subsection{Intended Readership}

This document is intended for the development team, the product client Dr. Harlan Onsrud, and any potential users and administrators of the system. The users will primarily be University of Maine faculty, such as instructors or course administrators. Other users may include instructors of courses at other universities, or anyone teaching a class outside a university setting who is interested in creating a course evaluation form.

The developers and Dr. Onsrud are most familiar with the system, so the ``References'' section is most relevant to them. University of Maine faculty should already be experienced with the format of the course evaluation form and will need little to no guidance to use the software. Other users should also be able to quickly pick up the software and make an evaluation form despite their unfamiliarity with its format. UMaine users may refer to the ``Overview'' section for a quick look at the system, and other users may refer to the ``Instructions'' section to learn the system's basic functionality.

\subsection{Applicability Statement}

This user manual specifically applies to the original release of the course evaluation system, version 1.0. The document may also be applicable to future releases but will not account for the newest features.

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of our system is to upgrade the University of Maine's system of processing course evaluation forms. The University has traditionally used Scantron sheets for course evaluation forms. It is tedious for students to fill in bubbles with pencil and paper. Also, school administrators must scan the forms for every student in every course, and the survey data must be collected in a form that is readable for instructors. The University of Maine has to keep up with technology by adopting a fully online solution, such as the one from Team EVAL.

This user manual is meant to provide essential information for operating our course evaluation system. It describes every function that a user can make, as well as useful procedures, warnings, and errors pertaining to the system. Overall, the software allows the process of creating, modifying, publishing, and viewing the statistics of an class evaluation form. With the user guide, one will know how to understand this process and execute it correctly and easily.

\subsection{How to Use This Document}

There are four main sections in this user manual. The first is the ``Introduction'' section, which introduces the readers to the system. It tells readers the target audience of the document, the purpose of Team EVAL's system, and why the user manual was written. The second section is the ``Overview'' section, a general description of what the course evaluation system does. It is meant to provide a quick guide to the software. Third, there is the ``Instructions'' section, intended for users less familiar with the system. It details every operation possible in the system, including warnings, procedures, input, results, and possible errors for each. Finally, the ``Reference'' section, for those highly familiar with the application, has more technical information about the system's operations.

Many sections of the manual relate to each other. The ``Overview'' section could be considered a more abstract version of the ``Instructions'' section. The reference section has similar information to ``Instructions'' but is more suitable for experienced users. A few appendix sections serve as a supplement to the main sections. Appendix A lists all possible error messages and their suggested recovery procedures. Next, Appendix B is a glossary, defining the more obscure terms in the document.

\section{Overview}

Team EVAL's course evaluation system has multiple capabilities for instructors to efficiently manage evaluation surveys. With the software, a user may create an online survey form, use a previously created form, edit a survey form, publish a form to students, or view statistics about a survey's responses.

The first pages the user sees upon starting the system are the landing pages. They include a summary of the system, frequently asked questions, and the log-in form. The user logs in with the e-mail address and password of a Google account. The system authenticates the log-in credentials, and the user reaches the system's home page.

The home screen has several options for the user to take. First, one may create a new course evaluation form. By creating a new survey, the user needs to import the course infomation such as course section, course designator, course title, course section, semester and calendar year and name of faculty unit. The second option is to edit a form that has been created but is still unpublished. Third, the user may view (but not edit) a published or inactive evaluation form. Finally, one can load a report giving statistics of the questions in course survey forms. A report applies to a particular category, such as a course section, course designator, instructor name, or university.

A major feature of the course evaluation system is editing a survey form before publishing it. If the user chose to create a new form, he or she may then select a preset form, loading the information of an existing form into the new one. While editing a form, the system allows setting the course information, including questions asking students about the course, adding custom open-ended questions, setting some questions as mandatory, listing the survey's participants, and writing e-mail templates about completing the survey to send to students.

After editing an evaluation form to what is desired, the user may then publish the survey, look at it later, and view its statistics. Upon publishing a survey, the system imports it into a survey creation software called LimeSurvey and sends invitation e-mails to the survey's participants. The user cannot edit a form that has been previously published. The system automatically sends reminder e-mails in case some students have not completed the survey.

An important capability of the system is to compile the responses for survey questions and output statistics of the responses. The user can view an evaluation report for a certain course section or designator, instructor last name, faculty unit, college, or university. The report gives the median, mean, standard deviation, and number of responses for 1-to-5 scale survey questions. The statistics are shown for each applicable course section, university department, and the whole university. The user may download the report as a file.

\section{Instructions}

\subsection{Logging In}
To begin using the course evaluation system a user first needs to log in. The initial screen, known as the landing page, has a login button featured on it. The only requirement to login to the system is a valid Gmail account. Once logged in a user will be directed to the home page where they will have access to the evaluation system. 

On the home page there are four operations a user can perform at any time. These include `Create Evaluation', `Edit Evaluation', `View Evaluation', and `View Results'.

\subsection{Create Evaluation}
When a user selects the `Create Evaluation' button they will be directed to a new screen to begin creating a new evaluation form. This operation is used to develop a survey that will eventually be published and sent out to a list of participants. The user can either create a new form from scratch or re-use an existing evaluation previously created.

If the user wants to create a new survey from scratch, they will have to first fill out the information about the course they are instructing or administering. This information includes the course designator, course title, year the course was held, instructors name and email, and other details about the course and its instructor. Each field must be filled out before the user can continue. Once they are satisfied with their course details they can continue onto the next portion of the survey creation process.

Once the course details have been filled out the user is now tasked with choosing what questions to include on their survey. There are several defaults questions that are customary in most course evaluation surveys, but the user also has the ability to create their own custom questions. For each question that appears the user has a choice to either include it, make it mandatory for the survey taker, or to exclude the question entirely.

The questions are split up into categories and some categories may not be applicable for some courses. The categories are: Course, Instructor, Assessment, Teaching Assistant, Laboratory, Online, and Open Ended. Some of these may not be relevant for every course. For example, if the course did not have a teaching assistant then the user could disregard these questions entirely. Once the user has picked and created the survey questions to their liking they are able to continue to the final page of creating an evaluation.

The final page required to create a survey form is an administrative one. The user is asked to list everyone enrolled in the course followed by this order : first name, last name and email address.The information for each student should appear in a separate row and be separated by commas. (e.g Mary, Smith, marysmith@gmail.com). This is how the survey will be distributed once it is published. The user can also edit the email these students will receive as well as opt-in or opt-out of reminder emails to be sent to the students. These emails will be sent to the students enrolled in the course 9, 6, and 3 days before the surveys must be completed.

Once the user is done with this page they are able to submit the survey. Once submitted they can choose to either save the survey to be published later or publish it right away. They will be routed back to the home page and they have successfully created an evaluation form.

\subsection{Edit Evaluation}
The edit evaluation operation is used if a user has previously created a survey form but has yet to publish it. The user has the ability to select their existing surveys from a drop-down menu and then can choose to edit one as they please.

Once a survey is selected it will bring the user to a similar page as when they created a survey from scratch. In this situation, however, all of the fields have already been filled out with what they previously entered. The user is then able to go through each page and edit the course information, the questions they've selected, and the enrollment list for the selected course. Once done the survey can either be saved again for further editing later or published and sent out to the participants.


\subsection{View Evaluation}
The view evaluation operation is used to view an older inactive survey form that has already gone through its lifetime. These surveys have already been distributed and taken by the participants in a previous year or semester. Once again the user can select the desired survey from a drop-down menu and choose which one they would like to view.

Once an evaluation has been selected, the user is directed to a page where they can view the information from this previous course. They are unable to edit this course as it has already been made inactive. The purpose of this is to simply view a past form and see what the course information was or which questions were included. At any point the user can return to the homepage when they are done viewing.
\subsection{View Results}
The view results operation is used to view the statistical results of a completed survey after it has run its course. It cannot be used for older surveys from past years or semesters, however. This only applies for the courses that have recently been completed and had their surveys taken.

To choose which course evaluation results are viewed, the user needs to first select what category they would like to sort the courses. The choices are as follows: Instructor, Course Section, Course Designator, Unit, College, and University. Once the user selects which category type they would like to sort by, they can choose the more specific category next. For example, if they select `instructor' the drop-down list would then consist of a list of instructors with surveys on their account. 

Once the user has selected the category type and specific category they would like to view, they can procede to the results screen. This screen will display the results for each question in each survey under the designated category. It will display statistics such as the median, mean, standard deviation, and number of participants for each question. This will allow the user to compare results across courses, and schools.
